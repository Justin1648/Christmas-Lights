This project is to run WS2815 lights directly from a Raspberry Pi
with no additional equipment.

Files needed to download to run the programs:

1. Raspberry Pi setup
    https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi
2. change default python version from python 2 to python 3
    https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-change-from-default-to-alternate-python-version-on-debian-linux
    
    
???

other stuff here as I figure it out.
